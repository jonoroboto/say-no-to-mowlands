    Welcome to the official Say no to Mowlands site.

    This website is part of a co-ordinated response by concerned local residents to an attempt to build 1,800 houses on the most productive/highest graded farmland in the Ashfield area. It also impacts upon one of only three local ancient monuments sites and associated settings of historical significance. Previous poor decisions to allow demolition of historically significant buildings in the vicinity led to the creation of the Kirkby Cross Conservation Area, in an attempt to preserve the local heritage. **Click the link to learn more.**
