_MM55 Proposed Main Modification – Page 77, after Policy SKA3 add new Sutton and Kirkby_

_Housing Site Allocations Policies, Paragraphs 5.48 - 5.76_

_Paragraph 5.48 – 5.76 – Amend supporting text and add new policies to set out individual_

_housing site specific details as follows:_

_Site SKA3al Mowlands, Kirkby. This greenfield site is located adjacent to the main urban_

_area, east of Kirkby and forms part of site K79 submitted for assessment in the SHLAA._

_The site is adjacent to Kirkby Cross Conservation Area (including a scheduled ancient_

_monument and listed buildings) to the south at the southern access point and any_

_development would need to be designed so as not to adversely affect its character. Boar_

_Hill escarpment is a prominent ridgeline in the landscape at the south-western edge of the_

_site. Located in the north of the site are two Local Wildlife Sites: Ashfield District By-pass_

_Meadows, and Fulwood Meadow. The site also sits adjacent to The Dumbles Ancient_

_Woodland. Access to the site via the public highway is currently restricted, however_

_opportunities do exist for appropriate access arrangements to be created. The site is_

_subject to potential surface water flooding. Access to the site is currently restricted but_

_consultation with the Highways Authority has indicated that this could be mitigated.                                                                                    _

_Included within the boundary of the site are Local Wildlife Sites and any development_

_would need to include mitigation of any impact on these. The site has provides an_

_opportunity for a well-integrated urban extension with potential to deliver a new primary_

_school, a commercial centre and quality public open space provision. The site has been_

_assessed as deliverable beyond 5 years and will only be brought forward as part of a_

_mixed use development with employment uses as set out in Policy SKA2. The allocation_

_will be required to provide land for a 1 ½ form entry primary school with the ability for the_

_school to be expanded to a 2 form entry (2 hectares). Contributions will be required along_

_with other sites identified in the Local Plan towards the school._

_Policy SKA3al: Mowlands, Kirkby_

_Site Area: 87.5 ha Approximate Yield: 900 dwellings_

_Strategic Objectives SO8, SO9, SO10, SO11, SO12, SO17, SO18, SO19, SO20_

_Residential development will be permitted on site SKA3al as shown on the Policies_

_Map, subject to detailed planning consent. Any future development proposal will need_

_Sutton Road. All existing opportunities will require some form of mitigation:_

_Meadows Local Wildlife Site, will require the translocation of the_

_grassland to another part of the site;_

1. _Any access route via Cow Pastures Lane will require measures to_

_mitigate negative impact the highway scheme would have on Kirkby_

_Cross Conservation Area. Such mitigation will include high quality,_

_sensitive design and necessary enhancements which acknowledge the_

_historic surrounding vernacular;_

_iii. Any access route taken via the allotments off Sutton Road, will require_

_new allotment provisions to be integrated within the new development;_

1. _c) A Heritage Statement that provides a proportionate assessment of the_

_significance of Kirkby Conservation Area and its setting, including Kirkby_

_Cross Scheduled Ancient Monument and nearby Listed Buildings, and an_

_primary school, enabling expansion to a 2 form entry school, if required;_

1. _g) An appropriate design scheme that:_
2. _Takes into consideration Bore Hill escarpment at the southern and_

_Ancient Woodland areas, and where appropriate buffers introduced._

_Detailed ecological and arboricultural assessments will be required_

2. _Improves A38 pedestrian bridge connections;_
3. _h) A minimum of 10% (8.75 ha) on-site open space for community uses, which_

_should include:_

_natural elements to encourage biodiversity, a contribution to improve_

_the existing park facilities, and the laying out of additional football_
