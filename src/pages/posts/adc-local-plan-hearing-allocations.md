KARA has now received notification of the allocated slots at which they can make representations at the upcoming Inspectors Hearings to be held at Ashfield D.C.'s Offices in Kirkby over the next two weeks.

The allocations are as follows:

_Matter 10:  The basis for the housing allocations and the settlement boundaries_

_Matter 12:  The housing allocations and the Main Urban Area boundaries: Sutton and Kirkby (Policy SKA3) _

_Matter 18:  Protecting and enhancing the environment (Policies EV1 to EV11)_

To coincide with these allocations we would like as many residents as possible turn up outside Ashfield D.C.'s offices to show their support for KARA's objections at the following dates and times:

_Day 1 - Monday 02/10/17 8.30am - (No KARA allocation BUT 1st day of the Hearings) _

_Day 6 - Monday 09/10/17 8.30am - (Matter 10)_

_Day 7 - Tuesday 10/10/17 8.30am - (Matter 12)_

_Day 9 - Thursday 12/10/17 1.30pm - (Matter 18)_

FINALLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT MOWLANDS IS NOT A DONE DEAL! WE CAN CHANGE IT, BUT WE NEED TO SHOW THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN! PLEASE DON'T JUST RELY UPON OTHERS, MAKE SURE YOU SHOW YOU'RE SUPPORT ON THE ABOVE DAYS!
