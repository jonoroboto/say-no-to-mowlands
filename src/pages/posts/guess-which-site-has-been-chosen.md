Here are two photos taken at two different road junctions (Hamilton Rd/Sherwood Way MARR Rd and A38/Sutton Rd) at exactly the same time of day. One of them has been selected for major development with subsequent increase in traffic the other has been rejected.  It shows perfectly why development of the Mowland Site would not only be a disaster for Kirkby but would also have knock on effects for the wider Ashfield Area.
