Can we please **URGE EVERYONE TO TURN UP AND SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR KARA** in the battle to stop Mowlands Farmland being designated for housing development.

This is the final week of The Hearings, after which the Inspector will decide if ADC's Local Plan is in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework and its legal/procedural requirements etc. If the Inspector decides the Plan is sound and meets the above criteria there will be very little that can be done to stop Mowlands being used for housing.

KARA will have at least one speaker (hopefully two) at the Hearings to voice their opposition to The Plan. The primary objection relates to the allocation and selection of Mowlands Farmland when more suitable locations have been either overlooked or discounted.

**WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE INSPECTOR THAT THERE IS STRONG LOCAL RESIDENTS OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! **

Those wishing to join the demonstration should turn up at Ashfield District Council, Kirkby - Main Entrance on the following dates and times:

Monday 9th October 8.30am

Tuesday 10th October 8.30am

Thursday 12th October 1.30pm

Following the 30 minute protest outside ADC's main entrance, hopefully most residents will want to go the public galleries within the offices to see KARA's representations to The Inspector.

Finally, a big **THANK YOU** to Roy and Fred who have the job of voicing **ALL OF OUR CONCERNS** when appearing on behalf of KARA at the Hearing!
