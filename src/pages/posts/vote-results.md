# **Result Of Ashfield D.C. Extraordinary General Meeting - Vote.**

Ashfield D.C. voted in favour option 2 which is to** "withdraw the Emerging Local Plan and commence development of a new Local Plan immediately".**

We would just take this opportunity to thank those Local Councillors (we all know who they are) who spoke at the meeting to voice their own real concerns relating to The Emerging Plan but also reflected KARA's own objections and issues.

We would also like to thank those KARA members that turned out at short notice to attend the meeting.
