# **Update On Mowlands Development.**

As you are probably aware Ashfield D.C. has changed leadership since our last newsletter. The new leader of the Council is Mr Jason Zadrozny (Ashfield Independents) who has been a keen supporter of KARA's fight to save Mowlands Farmland from future housing development for many years.

Jason has provided us with the below update on the current situation and the various available options.

_Mr. M. Slack,_ _KARA -  Kirkby in Ashfield,_ _Nottinghamshire          _ _25th May, 2018_

_Dear Mr. Slack, _  _Update: Housing Local Plan and Mowlands Allocation _  _As you will be aware I took over as Leader of Ashfield District Council three weeks ago.  I wanted to take this opportunity to write to you in your capacity as Chairman of the Kirkby Area Residents’ Association regarding my initial actions with the Council’s emerging Local Plan. _  _The Plan has been sitting with the Government Inspector for a number of months.  He is assessing its viability and has already made minor modifications, particularly around the areas of education provision.  The Authority has not yet been provided with any timeframes as to when the Inspector will conclude his deliberations and make a formal recommendation. _  _He has, though, three options.  Firstly, to instruct the Council to adopt the Plan as it is.  Secondly, to instruct the Council to review policy modifications before adoption and thirdly, to ask Council to withdraw their Plan and start again.  I am informed by the Council’s Legal Team that the third option is highly unlikely. _  _I have therefore, as one of my first actions as the new Leader instructed the Authority to commission Counsel’s legal opinion on the options and flexibilities available to my Administration.  We are still awaiting those opinions.   _  _I wanted to reassure you and other local residents of my commitment to ensuring that any forthcoming Plans are delivered with the best interests of Ashfield and seek to protect those sites like Mowlands on which we all have strong feelings.  I have taken the remit of the Planning Department so seriously that I have now taken all of those corporate responsibilities for that service area into the purview of the Leader of the Council. _  _As soon as there are any further developments I will of course inform you without delay. _  _As ever, kindest regards,  _  _Councillor Jason Zadrozny  Leader of the Council_

**We'll Keep You Updated With Further Developments As We Receive Them.**
