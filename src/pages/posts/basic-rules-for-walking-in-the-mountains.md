As you are probably aware the Hearings took place between Mon. 02/10/17 and Thurs. 12/10/17 at ADC's offices and are now complete.

During the Hearings the Inspector highlighted numerous areas in which the Plan needed modifications or rewording in order make it compliant with the requirements.

Obviously the first actions will be for ADC to alter the Plan to incorporate the amendments.

Finally, the Inspector will issue his report setting out his conclusions regarding the soundness of the Plan.

**When will residents get to hear the Inspectors conclusions?**

If the Inspector considers the Plan to be sound and without any need of amendment, he should issue his conclusions in early 2018.

If however he considers it needs major modifications then obviously that would be a lengthy process and would involve considerable work for ADC making the revisions.

There's a third option, which is, if the inspector considers the Plan unsound it effectively means "back to square one".
