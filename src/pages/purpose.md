**Kirkby Area Residents Association (KARA)** has produced this website, in response to _planning application V/2014/0664_ by W Westerman Limited referred to as the **Mowlands Development**. This application seeks approval from Ashfield District Council to build 1800 new houses which will completely cover Kirkby’s western boundary running from A38 to Pinxton Lane. This land is currently high quality agricultural fields producing much needed crops.

In addition to Westermans plans, Ashfield D.C. has recently included part of the proposed Mowlands Development land into its own Local Plan Preferred Approach. What this effectively means is they would change the classification from Countryside to Development Land thus opening the door to developers.

Its KARA’s belief that neither of the two proposals are sustainable, justified and in the best interests of existing Ashfield residents.
